\section{Main window}

There will be one main window for each application instance. Generally one instance should be used, but no limitation should be superimposed on the user.

The main window will consist of a menu and a tree view of files. Files can be nested in projects or standalone.

TODO: put an image of a window and an exemplary tree of files and projects

\section{YUV view window}

This window will contain a view of a single YUV file.
